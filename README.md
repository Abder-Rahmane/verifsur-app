    <h1>Identity Verification Application</h1>
    <p>The provided details discuss a sophisticated identity verification application. It uses Django's URL Dispatcher to ensure user-friendly navigation and provides the flexibility for users to navigate through the process according to their convenience. The foundation of this application is Django, which offers a streamlined development structure. For data extraction from ID images, the AWS OCR API is employed. Furthermore, the API Face JS is used for secure facial verification. Despite the complexities, the project was developed in just five days, showcasing the effective integration of diverse technologies to enhance security measures in identity verification.</p>
